# What is hosted-plus.

Hosted-plus is a little framework to make packaged google chrome application load all its JS and CSS files from a remote server.

It is also said that hosted-plus gives *hosted* google chrome application the permissions of a *packaged* one.

You normally don't need hosted-plus. I host it here for my own project where application design requires loading remote files and giving them permissons like cross-domain AJAX, chrome.management APIs, etc.

It is written in CoffeeScript and requires `npm -g install coffeescript` if you need to re-compile it.

Use Makefile to compile to JS, make CRX-package and even install an application.
